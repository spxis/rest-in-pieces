# Changelog

Notable user-facing changes are recorded here. The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 2.1.0 - 2026-09-28

### Added

- `/users`, `/products` and `/companies` datasets.
- Item routes for every dataset: `/names/42`, `/users/1`, `/countries/CA`.
- Field filters (`gender=female`, `age[gte]=30`, `province=Ontario,Quebec`) and `q` text search.
- `X-Total-Count` and `Link` headers, `metadata.links`, and ETags for conditional requests.
- `POST /generate` with a JSON body; `/generate` now offers 237 generator types and the same envelope as other collections.
- `/resources` for dataset discovery; `/health` reports the version.
- `fail` accepts a failure rate such as `0.2`; simulated responses carry `X-Simulated` and, for 429 and 503, `Retry-After`.
- Playground: every dataset, a table view with paging, search and filters, curl and fetch snippets, more scenarios, keyboard sending, and cancellation of superseded requests.
- The API serves the playground from the same origin when it has been built, including on Vercel and in Docker.

### Changed

- The OpenAPI document is generated from the request schemas and served with Scalar.
- Default ports are 8080 (API) and 5173 (playground).
- Upgraded the playground to Vite 8, `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6, lucide 1 and TypeScript 7; removed the unused Tailwind dependency.

### Fixed

- XML for bare arrays had several root elements; arrays are now wrapped as `<item>` lists and element names are made valid.
- `status` values outside 200–599 were clamped to 599; they are now ignored.
- `delay`, `status` and `fail` no longer affect `/health`, `/docs` or `/openapi.json`.
- An unsupported `format` is rejected before any work is done.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-09-27

- Rewrote the service in TypeScript on Hono, keeping every URL and query parameter.
- Added seeded data, response formats, failure simulation, a browser playground, and Docker and Vercel configurations.
